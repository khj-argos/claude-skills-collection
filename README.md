## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude **Skills** are specialized modules that Claude can use to perform structured, multi-step tasks. Each skill is a lightweight folder with a clear instruction interface, and optionally includes Python code, templates, and assets.

Skills allow Claude to:
- Create and edit documents (Word, Excel, PPT)
- Parse and analyze structured data
- Write and debug code
- Generate creative visual assets
- Automate research, testing, or collaboration tasks

Official Skills are created by Anthropic and auto-invoked when needed. You can also install or build custom skills to meet your unique workflow needs.
